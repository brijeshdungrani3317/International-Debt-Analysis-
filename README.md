# International Debt Analysis: 
Analyzing international debt data collected by The World Bank, which includes information on the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several debt categories. The analysis aims to answer key questions regarding the total debt amount, the country with the maximum debt, and the average debt across different debt indicators.

# Key Analysis Components:

1.) Data Exploration 🗃️:

Connected to the international_debt database to extract data.
Displayed an initial sample of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

2.) Country Analysis 🌎:

Determined the number of unique countries in the dataset, totaling 124.
Analyzed which country holds the maximum amount of debt.

3.) Debt Indicator Analysis 💰:

Identified the distinct debt indicators that specify the purpose of the debts taken by each country.
Calculated the average amount of debt owed across these different indicators to understand the areas of indebtedness.

# Methods and Tools:

SQL: For querying and data extraction from the international debt database.
Python: For data analysis and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and presentation.

# This project offers insights into the international debt landscape, highlighting the extent and areas of debt for developing countries, which could be valuable for economists, policymakers, and researchers.
